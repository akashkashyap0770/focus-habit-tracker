• Project documentation (README)
• Wireframe / UI planning reference

Please ensure your submission is well organized and includes working instructions where applicable.
A short demo video (screen recording) is highly recommended.

Please email your submission to:

hr@kalvig.in

Late submissions may not be considered.

Internship Overview & Expectations

To ensure clarity and transparency, please review the key details of the internship:

• Internship duration: Six months
• Mode: Remote with flexible working hours
• Initial onboarding: Unpaid internship
• Performance evaluation at three months: candidates meeting expectations may be considered for a stipend, based on requirements
• Final evaluation at internship completion (After 6 Months) for potential long-term roles
• Minimum duration for internship certification: Three months
• Daily stand-ups and consistent participation are expected

Compensation decisions (stipend / role opportunities) are strictly performance-based and not guaranteed.

This opportunity is best suited for candidates who are actively seeking practical industry exposure, skill development, and hands-on project experience.

Evaluation focuses on problem solving, structure, and implementation approach rather than visual perfection.

About Kalvig Technologies

Kalvig is a Creative Technology-focused company working across multiple domains, including:

• Full-stack web development (frontend & backend systems)
• Interactive and virtual content solutions (3D Web)
• Animation and game development
• Experimental and emerging technology projects

Our work focuses on building real-world solutions, prototypes, and interactive systems rather than purely academic exercises.

We are currently working on advanced initiatives, including AI-powered 3D content generation products. Interns demonstrating strong performance and problem-solving ability may have opportunities to contribute to such projects.

Alongside project work, interns receive exposure to modern tools, workflows, and evolving technology practices through structured guidance and learning resources.

If you are comfortable with the internship structure and expectations, we encourage you to proceed with the assignment submission.

Web Development Intern Evaluation Assignment
Project Title
Focus & Habit Tracker – Interactive Productivity Dashboard

Objective:
Build a small but structured web application that simulates a real product experience.
The goal of this assignment is to evaluate:
• Frontend development skills
• Backend & API design
• Database modelling
• UI / UX & layout decisions
• Animation & interaction handling
• Three.js visualization capabilities
• Code structure & engineering approach
This is not a pixel-perfect design challenge.
We are primarily evaluating problem solving, structure, and implementation
decisions.

Core Concept:
Design a productivity-style application where users can:
➢ Authenticate into the system
➢ Log daily activities / habits
➢ View historical records on a calendar
➢ View weekly analytics
➢ Experience animated UI interactions
➢ Visualize analytics using Three.js
The application should feel like a coherent micro-product, not isolated pages.

Functional Requirements:
Authentication Layer (Required)
The application must start with a login system.
You may choose any one of the following approaches:
• Custom authentication (email / password + sessions or JWT)
• Firebase Authentication
• Clerk / Auth0 / similar services
Requirements:
✔ Users must be able to sign up & log in
✔ Protected routes / pages
✔ Basic validation & error handling
Choice of implementation is flexible.

Daily Log Section (Required)
Authenticated users should be able to log activities.
Each log entry must contain:
• Activity Name
• Duration (minutes)
• Category (example: Work / Study / Exercise / Break / etc.)
• Timestamp (auto generated)
Features:
✔ Add new entry
✔ Delete entry
✔ Input validation
✔ Smooth UI updates

History Section (Required)
Users must be able to view past activity records.

Requirements:
✔ Calendar-style view OR date-grouped history
✔ Clicking a day reveals entries
✔ Clear visual organization
Implementation choice is flexible.

Analytics Section (Required)
Provide a weekly overview of logged habits.
Analytics scope (keep simple):
✔ Total duration per day
✔ Category distribution per week
Visualization requirement:
This section must include a bar graph representation.

Three.js Requirement (High Evaluation Weightage):
The analytics visualization should be implemented using Three.js.
Minimum expectations:
• Bars represent weekly data
• Bars animate upward when page/section loads
• Visual distinction between categories (color / material / styling)
• Data sourced from actual application records
Important constraints:
• No need for camera controls
• No orbit interactions required
• Focus on data-driven visualization & animation
If Three.js implementation is not feasible, you may create a standard frontend
visualization however, Three.js solutions carry significantly higher evaluation
weightage.

UI / UX & Animation Expectations:
Your application should demonstrate thoughtful interface behaviour.
Examples:
• Smooth transitions
• Animated state updates
• Expand / collapse interactions
• Hover / feedback effects
• Clear layout hierarchy
Avoid:
• Plain unstyled layouts
• Abrupt UI changes
• Default template-only interfaces

Technical Constraints:
You may choose your preferred stack.
Examples:
• React / Vanilla JS / Next.js
• Node.js / Express / Flask / Django / etc.
• MongoDB / SQL / Firebase / etc.
Requirements:
• Persistent data storage
• API-based data flow
• No hardcoded analytics values

Project Structure Expectations:
Your project should logically separate concerns:
• UI / Frontend Layer

• Backend / API Layer
• Database / Storage Layer
• Visualization / Three.js Layer
Clean organization is preferred over complexity.

Submission Requirements:
Please submit the following:
Source Code
• GitHub repository link
• Properly structured project
Live Project
• Hosted application link (Vercel / Render / Netlify / etc.)
Documentation (Required)
Include a README.md describing:
• Project overview
• Tech stack used
• Setup instructions
• Data model / schema
• Analytics logic
• Three.js mapping logic (if implemented)
• Assumptions & decisions
Documentation quality is part of evaluation.

UI Wireframe / Design Planning (Required):
Provide a basic design reference.
Acceptable formats:
• Figma link
• Image / PDF / Sketch

Should reflect:
• Page layout ideas
• User journey thinking
• Screen structure
This is not judged for artistic perfection.

Time Expectations:
You are given up to 2 days to complete the assignment.
Important:
Submission quality is more important than full completion.
If some features are incomplete:
• Submit your progress
• Document what is missing
• Explain intended approach
Incomplete but well-structured work is valued more than rushed hacks.

Evaluation Focus:
We are evaluating:
• Problem solving & clarity
• Code organization
• Logical thinking
• UI behaviour
• Data handling
• Engineering decisions
Not minor styling details.

If anything is unclear, document your assumptions and proceed. Good luck!!
